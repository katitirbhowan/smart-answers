Marriage in Bulgaria

Contact the relevant local authorities in Bulgaria to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

To get a CNI, you must get your documents witnessed in Bulgaria. You can do this at the British embassy in Sofia or in front of a notary public.

CNIs issued in Bulgaria are valid for 6 months.

You’ll need to have been living in Bulgaria for at least 3 full days before you can post notice, for example if you arrive in the country on Thursday, the earliest you can post notice is the following Monday.

The British embassy or notary public can take your oath or affirmation and witness your notice of marriage. The notary public may charge 2 separate fees for this.

### Get your documents witnessed in front of a notary public

Download an [‘Affidavit/Affirmation’ form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form) and a [‘Notice of Marriage’ form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2) and take them with you to a notary public.

Once the notary public has witnessed your documents, send the original documents to the British embassy in Sofia:

The embassy will contact you to confirm that the payment was accepted.

The embassy will display your notice of marriage publicly for 7 days before issuing your CNI.

You can collect the CNI from the embassy or ask for it to be sent by courier to an address in Bulgaria. You’ll need to pay any courier fees.

Make an appointment to collect your CNI at the embassy in Sofia.

^You don’t need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.^

Once you have your CNI, you must contact the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to get it legalised (certified as genuine).
