Marriage in Bulgaria

Contact the [Embassy of Bulgaria](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Bulgaria](/foreign-travel-advice/bulgaria) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Local registry offices in Bulgaria do not accept UK-issued CNIs. You must get a UK-issued CNI then exchange it for a locally-issued CNI.

### Get a UK-issued CNI

You can normally get a CNI by giving a notice of marriage at your local register office or registrar in the UK. Find your local office or registrar in [England and Wales](https://www.gov.uk/register-offices), [Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm), [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us).

^A CNI issued in Scotland is valid for 3 months. A CNI issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland will not expire. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. You should also check with the local authorities in Bulgaria to find out how long a CNI is valid under local law.^

### Exchange your CNI for a locally-issued one

You must make an appointment at the British embassy in Sofia to to exchange your UK-issued CNI for a locally-issued one.
